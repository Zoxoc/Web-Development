In this project, we develop a website to check a persons heart health based on the various inputs.
Inputs are collected from a assesment on the website and this is a one page website
how we calculate is done by machine learning's logistic regression model.
The model's code is there in another repository: "Practice-Projects/Logistic Regression/heart_disease.ipynb"
and we take the final weights of the trained model and calculate it using javascript
This is only a front-end project with basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript
